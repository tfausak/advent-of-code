# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). There
is a top-level folder for each year. Inside each of those is a folder for each
day. I write my solutions in Haskell, and I recommend that you use [Stack][] to
run them. For example:

``` sh
$ stack 2018/1/1.hs < 2018/1/input.txt
439
```

These solutions aren't meant to show best practices. They're quick and dirty.
They are probably too clever for their own good.
